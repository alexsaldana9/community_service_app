TheGood

This is a community service app. If you are a non-profit you can post your events and have users attend. It will work great for students that are required community service hours, and events will include different categories, like feeding the hungry, environmental, elderly care, animal care, etc.


Future goals:

"Pay It Forward" mechanism for inviting friends

Making community organizers and non-profits a special kind of user

Email subscriptions for staying up to date on chosen Event Categories

Pages for photo sharing and tagging friends
