TheGood

This is a community service app. If you are a non-profit you can post your event and have users attend. It will work great for students that are required community service hours, and they can keep a log of the events, which will include different categories: feed the homeless, environmental, elderly care, animal care, etc.

It will be great if we can do a "Pay It Forward" kind of thing. You can invite friends over to do the good.

2 types of users: service providers (students, regularGOOD people) and event community service managers (organizations).

Notes:
logo = earth hold by a hand
show the events in google maps 
have users fill a profile - name, address, radius willing to travel,
email subscription for type of events (health, elderly, animal care, homeless help)
send email alerts to users according to their interests and events that will happen in the area
later on have a photo sharing event page, and tag along facebook fiends
